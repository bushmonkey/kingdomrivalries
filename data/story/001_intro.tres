You just landed on K2-18b, your new home. Your job is to rebuild life in this new world.

With your small crew, you can make 3 decisions a month and will need to cope with unexpected issues as they arise but such is the life of a captain.

You are 30 years old, unmarried and need to think about future generations to keep your way of life going after you're going.

Good luck."
